Several Covid-19 Vaccines have been authorized by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Using the official data of the clinical trials from the EMA [webpage](https://www.ema.europa.eu/), we can compute the efficacy for each vaccine in different clinical trial contexts.

The Covid-19 vaccines we are going to review are as follows:
- Comirnaty
- Nuvaxovid
- Ronapreve
- Xevudy
- Spikevax

We will perform a study on each of the trials of these vaccines.

Effectiveness
In medicine, effectiveness refers to how well a treatment works in real-world settings, as demonstrated through pragmatic clinical trials. This is distinct from efficacy, which measures how well a treatment performs under ideal conditions, such as in controlled research studies or clinical trials.

To quantify effectiveness, we use the following formula:

$\text{Effectiveness} = \frac{\text{Theta Placebo} - \text{Theta Vaccine}}{\text{Theta Placebo}} \times 100$

This formula calculates the percentage difference in outcomes between the treated and control groups, providing a measure of how effectively the treatment performs in practical, everyday conditions.
